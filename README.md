### Localization
While the error messages and a few other strings are properly stored in strings.xml, the symbols
used on the calculator are hardcoded within `CalculorButtons.kt`. I did this for the sake of time
and simplicity since solving for this would include either
* Creating a wrapper class for string resources to inject into the ViewModel for safe access
* Translating between a model that represents the operands and the string resources in the UI layer

Additionally, it felt less important to solve for this during this first iteration since, after
checking the Google calculator app with a few different languages, I only noticed that sometimes
a comma is used in place of a period for the decimal point while the other symbols remain the same.
